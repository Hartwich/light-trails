# Light Trails

Light Trails is an optional Open Party Lab game package.

This repo is not a standalone app. Run it through the Open Party Lab platform:

```bash
cd ../../
npm install
npm run games:sync-local
npm run dev:all
```

The platform loads this game only when the repo exists locally and `npm run games:sync-local` links it.
